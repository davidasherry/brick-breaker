# Brick-Breaker
A remake of the classic retro game, brick-breaker. The objective of the game is to bounce the ball on the game canvas off of your paddle to destroy the bricks. By colliding the ball and brick, you will score a point, and eliminate the brick. This is a bare bones creation of the classic game.
